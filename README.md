# CP2K manual for electronic structure calculations


In this repository we have provided the inputs for different types of electronic structure calculations. The same files are aslo available in other places as well (SP_MB, CsPbI3) for use in nonadiabatic dynamics. However, here we provide detailed information on how to use CP2K and how the inputs functionality and timings changes.
