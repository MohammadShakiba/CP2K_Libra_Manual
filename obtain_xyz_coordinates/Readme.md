# Obtaining the `xyz` coordinates from `cif` files

In order to obtain the structure coordinates, we will use [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) software. For more information on how to use VESTA software we highly 
recommend you to watch and use the useful videos on the [Nickel and Copper YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmOHJtv6B2IFqzGpJakANeg).
